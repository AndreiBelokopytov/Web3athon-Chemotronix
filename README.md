# Web3athon-Chemotronix
Chemotronix is a generic mix of IoT,A.I and Blockchain that fosters the reduction of carbon emissions in its deployed location, and allows users to trade carbon credits. 
The blockchain is used to register a unique ID attached to the IoT device. With this unique ID, users can transfer and share carbon credits(an ERC-20 token) among themselves without needing to remember their addresses.
The data from the IoT device is saved to web3storage(built on ipfs), instead of a traditional cloud storage, to avoid a single point of failure.
